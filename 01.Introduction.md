## Prerequisites for hands-on following

1. Install the `clang` C++ compiler for readable compiler errors and warnings:
   ```
   sudo apt install clang
   ```
2. Add the following to your `.vscode/tasks.json` file:
   ```
   {
      "version": "2.0.0",
      "tasks": [
         {
            "type": "cppbuild",
            "label": "C/C++: clang++ build active file",
            "command": "/usr/bin/clang++",
            "args": [
               "-fcolor-diagnostics",
               "-fansi-escape-codes",
               "-g",
               "${file}",
               "-o",
               "${fileDirname}/bin/${fileBasenameNoExtension}"
            ],
            "options": {
               "cwd": "${fileDirname}"
            },
            "problemMatcher": [
               "$gcc"
            ],
            "group": "build",
            "detail": "compiler: /usr/bin/clang++"
         },
         {
            "type": "shell",
            "label": "C/C++: run active file",
            "command": "${fileDirname}/bin/${fileBasenameNoExtension}",
            "args": [],
            "options": {
               "cwd": "${fileDirname}"
            },
            "group": "build",
            "dependsOn": "C/C++: clang++ build active file"
         }
      ]
   }
   ```

Active files with `cpp` file extensions can now be compiled and run with `run tasks`.
