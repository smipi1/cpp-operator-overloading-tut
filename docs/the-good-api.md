# The good API

A good API is easy to use (and learn), but hard to misuse:
- Known as the [Easy To Use And Hard To Misuse (EUHM) principle](http://principles-wiki.net/principles:easy_to_use_and_hard_to_misuse).
- Runs contrary to [Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS) principle](http://principles-wiki.net/principles:keep_it_simple_stupid), but both call for simplicity:
  - KISS calls for simple implementations. Simple implementations tend to be hard to use, and easy to misuse.
  - EUHM calls for simplified use, and complicated / impossible misuse. Accepts increased complexity in the implementation.
